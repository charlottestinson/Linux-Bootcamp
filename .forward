The use of .forward files is not supported at UTCS.

If you are trying to get your mail forwarded to another
address, log in with your EID here:

  https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/udb/update/

Warning: we cannot forward email after your account has
expired.

If you are trying to use a .forward file to automate the
preprocessing of incoming mail using a filter, that is also
unsupported. The procmail service is available for this
purpose. Read more at
